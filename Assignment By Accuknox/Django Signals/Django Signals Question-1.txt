1.By default are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously?

Django signals are executed synchronously by default. This means that when a signal is sent, Django will run the connected receiver functions immediately before continuing with the rest of the callerâ€™s code.


signals.py

import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import MyModel


@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def slow_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal started")
    time.sleep(4) 
    print("Signal completed")


views.py

from django.shortcuts import HttpResponse
from .models import MyModel

def create_view(request):
    print("Before save")
    MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
    print("After save")
    return HttpResponse("Done")

output:
Before save
Signal started
      
wait 4 seconds

Signal completed
After save
